Task on RootMe: https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/App-Script/sudo-weak-configuration
Video Solution: https://youtu.be/UEGzf_Ba4HQ

To read the .passwd located in the following PATH:
/challenge/app-script/ch1/ch1cracked/
we need to know what command we may run as sudo.
With 'sudo -l' command we can see this command.
In this task we can run /bin/cat as user app-script-ch1-cracked in /challenge/app-script/ch1/notes/*
To run command as another user:
sudo -u app-script-ch1-cracked /bin/cat /challenge/app-script/ch1/notes/../ch1cracked/.passwd
